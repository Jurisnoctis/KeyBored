Windows - I have only tested Windows 7 x64. I haven't tested anything else - would appreciate pull requests to fix it if some OS isn't supported)\r\n\r\n## Building from source\r\n\r\n### JAR\r\n\r\n1. Close this repo\r\n2. Run `gradle fatjar` (install gradle if needed)\r\n3. Resulting jar will be in `build/libs` - this should be runnable.\r\n\r\n(to create Eclipse project, run `gradle eclipse`)\r\n\r\n### OS X\r\n\r\n1. Build the jar\r\n2. Run `ant -f bundle-osx.xml` (install ant if needed, or just run this from eclipse)\r\n3. Resulting .app will be in `build`\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\n1. Build the jar\r\n2. Run `ant -f bundle-windows.xml` (install ant if needed, or just run this from eclipse)\r\n3. Resulting .exe will be in `build`\r\n\r\n## FAQ / Troubleshooting\r\n### Isn't this a clone of a program I saw 6 years ago?\r\nYep! I wrote that one, too. I've been meaning to get a proper version of it out there since 2009.\r\n\r\n### It says version 4? Where are the others?\r\nVersion 1 was a bare-bones command line Windows application that _worked_ but had many problems. Version 2 was a hackmess of java and C++ that also only ran on Windows, but was more flexible. Version 3 was a pure-java attempt when I didn't really know what I was doing, yet. That last one's on sourceforge if you really want to google it - the source for the other two is lost to time (and frankly, I'm ok with that - it was really really bad).\r\n\r\n### I'm getting an error on OS X like \"Assistive Device not enabled,\" help\r\nOS X needs to have the app (or java jar launcher, or IDE, or termal app) specifically enabled for assistive devices. See [Apple's knowledgebase](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6026) for how to do that in Mavericks.\r\n\r\n### My antivirus thinks this is a virus/keylogger.\r\nIt isn't - check the source. It sets off some red flags because it's listening for keyboard activity globally, which is something keyloggers do.\r\n\r\n### I closed the window, but the sounds keep happening oh my god make it stop\r\nIf your OS supports a tray (Windows and OSX do), it's minimized to the tray. Right-click the icon and select \"Quit KeyBored\" to make it stop.\r\n\r\n### I have a problem that isn't listed here.\r\nTake a look at the [issues list](https://github.com/forana/KeyBored/issues).
